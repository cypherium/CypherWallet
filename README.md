# Project commissioning

Project debugging including Web, android, ios.

Web-based debugging

Running ionic Serve opens the link automatically in the browser and all changes are hot-updated to the browser without a manual refresh.

` ` `
Build: ionic cordova build browser  
` ` `
Because the > back-end interface is not currently configured across domains, front-end access is required to turn off chrome's security Settings. Exit Chrome completely, and then start using the ** -opena "Google Chrome" --args --disable-web-security --user-data-dir _** command line

Debugging based on android Studio

If you need to debug your plug-in, use native debugging. The commands to add and compile the project are as follows:

` ` `
Add: ionic cordova platform add android@latest    
Delete: ionic cordova platform rm android   
Check: ionic cordova platform ls   
Build: ionic cordova build android --prod --release   
Run to real machine: ionic cordova run android   
` ` `

You can open the project directory under the project directory, platforms/ android directory, with android Studio, and then conduct android debugging

Xcode-based debugging

If you need to debug your plug-in, use native debugging. The commands to add and compile the project are as follows:

` ` `
Add: ionic cordova platform add ios@latest   
Delete: ionic cordova platform rm ios   
Check: ionic cordova platform ls  
Build: ionic cordova build ios --prod  
Run to real machine: ionic cordova run ios
